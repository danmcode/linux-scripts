# 🔄 Bareos Volume Cleanup Script Explanation

This script is used to **find and delete Bareos volumes** that are in an `"Error"` status from the Bareos catalog. It uses the Bareos console (`bconsole`) to list and delete volumes.

## 🔍 How the Script Works

### 1. Define the target status

- The script sets a variable that specifies which volume status should be deleted.
- In this case, the status is **`Error`**.

### 2. Fetch all volumes

- The script runs the `list volumes` command through `bconsole`.
- The output is stored in a variable for processing.

### 3. Filter only error volumes

- From the output, it selects only those volumes that have the status `Error`.
- It extracts the column that contains the volume names.

### 4. Loop through each error volume

- The script iterates over each volume that matched the `"Error"` status.
- For each one, it prepares a delete command.

### 5. Delete the volumes

- The script sends a `delete volume=<volume_name> yes` command to `bconsole`.
- The `yes` confirms deletion automatically without asking the user.

## 📌 Use of the Script

- The script is useful for **cleaning up Bareos catalogs** by automatically removing volumes that are marked with an error status.
- It helps administrators avoid manual cleanup and ensures the catalog only contains usable volumes.
